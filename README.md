# Sports-Meet-Prototipe-App
Prototipe of a Sports app.
Our group is developing a platform that allows athletes of individual sports, like tennis or golf, to post when they are looking for someone to play against. Our app will match them with someone in a similar location. There will be a rating system where players rate themselves when registering and then rate the people that they have played against. This will allow us to match players of similar standards. The app will be useful for high-performing athletes who want to find a well-matched opponent for practice, or it will be useful for people just getting into a sport and looking for more of a social game.
